This is part 1 which includes Initial thoughts, Development Methodology and High-Level Design / Architecture 


Initial thoughts:
User Experience (UX):
Volunteers: The web interface should be responsive and accessible across devices, with a simple dashboard displaying upcoming events, preferences, and availability updates.
Administrators: An intuitive admin panel should allow quick event creation, volunteer management, and access to analytics for monitoring participation.

Key Functionalities:
Registration & Authentication: Secure web-based authentication with email verification. Minimal initial registration, with profile completion on first login.
Profile Management: Volunteers can easily update location, skills, preferences, and availability.
Event Management: Admins create events with details like skills, location, and urgency, displayed on volunteer dashboards based on relevance.
Volunteer Matching: Server-side algorithm matches volunteers to events based on profiles and event requirements.
Notification System: Web push or email notifications keep volunteers informed about assignments and reminders.
Volunteer History: Admins can track and export volunteer participation via a simple table or dashboard.

Technology Stack:
Front-End: React.js for a responsive UI with Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling, or HTML/CSS with JavaScript as an alternative.
Back-End: Either Flask (Python) or Node.js with Express.js for API handling and business logic.
Database: PostgreSQL for relational data or MongoDB for NoSQL.
Authentication: Firebase Authentication or JWT with Passport.js.
APIs: Google Maps for location services, Twilio for SMS, or SendGrid for email notifications.


Development Methodology:
We are going to use Agile, the reason we are going with agile is since it allows you to add on new features one at a time adding to the whole 
project step by step. With agile we will be doing 5 steps for each part:

Planning: Plan what needs to be done and in which order , assign roles, and plan each detail with the team
Development: After discussing and planning working on solving the problems and tasks discussed
Testing: after developing create test cases and insure correct functionality of the code/design
Deployment: deploy parts that were developed into the full project and ensure its working properly together with the rest of the components 
Review: to ensure everything is working properly review and retest everything after everything is integrated together
