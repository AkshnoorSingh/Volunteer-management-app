This is part 1 which includes Initial thoughts, Development Methodology and High-Level Design / Architecture 


Initial thoughts:


Development Methodology:
We are going to use Agile, the reason we are going with agile is since it allows you to add on new features one at a time adding to the whole 
project step by step. With agile we will be doing 5 steps for each part:

Planning: Plan what needs to be done and in which order , assign roles, and plan each detail with the team
Development: After discussing and planning working on solving the problems and tasks discussed
Testing: after developing create test cases and insure correct functionality of the code/design
Deployment: deploy parts that were developed into the full project and ensure its working properly together with the rest of the components 
Review: to ensure everything is working properly review and retest everything after everything is integrated together 


High-Level Design / Architecture:
